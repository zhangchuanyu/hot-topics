The time value of money is a financial concept that basically says money at hand today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future. Simply put, $1 today is far more valuable than $1 in the future.This is due to the potential the current money has to earn more money. This is an important concept to understand in finance.Suffice to say, the amount of money that you make is not the only thing that matters. It matters if the money is received today or in the future.The time value of money can work for you or against you. For example, if you are deciding between buying a new phone for 1000 dollars, or invest in a stock for example that yields 10% per year. If you buy the phone, you have just incurred an opportunity cost of 10%. No matter how you slice it, every financial decision you make have an impact on your quality of life and the ability to enjoy the things you love.

<p>Genetically modified food (or GM food) is food produced from plants or animals whose DNA has been altered through genetic engineering. These genetically modified organisms are often called GMOs for short.Genetic engineering is the process of manipulating an organism’s genes directly — by, for example, transplanting DNA from other organisms. It’s different from the conventional method of selectively breeding plants and animals to get desired traits. Genetically modified foods have been on the US market since 1994, ever since the introduction of ”Flavr Savr” tomatoes that had been engineered to ripen more slowly.There’s no one type of genetically modified organism — genetic engineering is a tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. Most of the corn and soy grown in the United States has been genetically modified to be resistant to herbicides, so that it’s easier to spray fields with weed killer. Other crops have been modified to withstand pests. But genetic engineering could conceivably help create crops that can survive drought, or help produce food that’s more nutritious.

Global models of tide, storm surge, and wave setup are used to obtain projections of episodic coastal flooding over the coming century. The models are extensively validated against tide gauge data and the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on projections estimated in detail. Global “hotspots” where there is projected to be a significant change in episodic flooding by the end of the century are identified and found to be mostly concentrated in north western Europe and Asia. Results show that for the case of, no coastal protection or adaptation, and a mean RCP8.5 scenario, there will be an increase of 48% of the world’s land area, 52% of the global population and 46% of global assets at risk of flooding by 2100.
